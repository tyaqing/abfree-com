2. We will not delete the images you upload, but we reserve the right to delete images that violate laws and regulations. This includes but is not limited to pornographic, violent, insulting, defamatory, infringing on others' rights, or other illegal content. Before uploading any images, you need to ensure that you have all necessary rights and permissions, including but not limited to copyrights, trademark rights, portrait rights, or other applicable rights.
