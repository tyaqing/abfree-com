After Figma Dev mode became chargeable, we added an editing mode that can also compress and export images!

## Export Format Support

We support compressing multiple formats and resolutions of images at the same time, but the rules are limited to **5** or less. The supported image formats include PNG, JPG, WEBP, SVG, AVIF.

## History Records

The compressed images by this plugin will be permanently stored on your computer until you clear your cache or history records. Due to client storage limitations, we only save **15** historical records.

## Future Plans

- Image compression supports parameter adjustment
- Supports one-click upload to CDN
